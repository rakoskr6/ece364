This course is very poorly managed and the content of the course is outdated and not necessary. This lab could (and should) be a wonderful opportunity to to teach engineers how to intuitively understand electronics. Instead, students are too busy meeting the requirements of the lab report to actually take the time to learn something. Alternatively, a designer could be taught how to intuitively create and understand components. After this point the math could be introduced. 

In addition to the poor material the lab manual is horribly written. There are countless errors and discrepancies throughout all labs. It would be understandable if it was a new experiment; however, these manuals are the exact same as the previous year. Therefore, it is entirely laziness and ineptitude by the professor who doesn't take the time to update the manuals. While a 200 level course may not be the most important thing in the world, we as students should have a professor who is actually striving to teach us information instead of being fine with mediocrity. If his name is on the course, he is responsible for it and can't blame the TAs.

Finally, the lab equipment in the course is horribly out of date. At one point I was told to use a floppy drive for transferring oscilloscope images. Additionally, poor equipment makes the lab significantly longer as we wait for things to load.
